# Need to Be Done

1. Figure out why it only runs on local computer. This is I think to do with the system tray. Like because virtual don't allow that maybe. Does run on your desktop.

2. It for some reason misses first set of keys. The first 17. So the first key that can be used is the 18th. I haven't figured that one out yet.


Any help to better the code is appreciated. I'm completely new to GitHub so bear with me. I know there is likely better methods to do what I am. Everything and anything is welcome. Thank you so much.
