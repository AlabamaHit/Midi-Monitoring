# Midi-Monitoring
This allows you to run anything inside built on python. For an example, I use this personally to be able to use my keyboard(electric) to run task for me. Opening programs, writing times into files, etc. 

# IN DEVELOPMENT - WORKS BUT NOT FINISHED

Any help to better the code is appreciated. I'm completely new to GitHub so bear with me. I know there is likely better methods to do what I am. Everything and anything is welcome. Thank you so much.

# Tested on

I have tested it with my Yahama YPT-300. I used a MIDI to USB cable, to connect. The setting on my keyboard is "PC 2" in the functions on the keyboard. I am running Windows 10.
